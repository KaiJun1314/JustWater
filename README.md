# JustWater
Compared to earlier eras, people today are busier at work. They neglect their daily water intake because of this. Indirectly, there is a sharp rise in the number of health issues. As a result, the mobile application â€“ JustWater is developed to help user keep track of their daily water intake. This application was created to remind users to drink enough water each day and help prevent illnesses brought on by dehydration.
